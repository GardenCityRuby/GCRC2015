  title: Profiling Ruby applications

  description:
    Since the release of ruby 2.1, the language has improved in many areas.

    Lots of improvements to garbage collection, and tuning options Hooks to
    monitor life cycles of objects, and to monitor GC

    Compared to other languages like Java, C or c++, Ruby does not have
    a beginner friendly plug-and-play profiling tool that doesn't
    require you to patch Ruby.  This workshop aims at showing how we
    can profile Ruby applications, make use of new tracepoints in Ruby
    to hook into life cycle of objects and make sense of the data
    collected.
