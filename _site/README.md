The webfonts are delivered by Typekit and the default host configured in
the service is `localhost`. Use the following command to start a simple
HTTP server to get the fonts to work:

    python -m SimpleHTTPServer

For now, the two fonts in use are: 'Abril Fatface' intended for
headings, and 'PT Sans' for body copy.
